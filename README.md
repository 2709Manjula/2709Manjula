### 👩‍💻 I'm currently working as a Trainee at [BlueScope](https://www.bluescopetech.com/)  
📍 Location: [BlueScope Locations]([https://www.bluescope.com/about-bluescope/where-we-operate/](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//2nd+Floor,+Rakshi+Sai+Building,+Sai+Baba+Kovil+St,+Bhuvaneshwari+Nagar,+Gowriwakkam,+Sembakkam,+Chennai,+Tamil+Nadu+600073/@12.9545625,80.1644599,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a525ea2b3e08eab:0x28ec0bfa5afc2879!2m2!1d80.2468618!2d12.9545754?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D))

- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into **Spring Boot** to understand how to build scalable backend services.
- 🤝 I’m actively looking to **collaborate with fellow Java Backend Developers** on real-world projects, open-source contributions, or tech-based communities.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to **Java**, **MySQL**, **REST APIs**, or any of my **projects** — I love discussing backend architecture and clean code.
- 😄 **Fact about me :** I'm naturally confident and technically curious — I enjoy debugging, exploring new backend strategies, and transforming logic into clean solutions.

### 🤝 Let’s Collaborate!

I'm excited to connect with developers who are passionate about:
- 🔧 Java + Spring Boot backend systems
- 🗂️ Database & API integration
- 🧪 Building real-world apps from scratch or from scratchy ideas
